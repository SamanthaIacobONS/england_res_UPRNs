## Tracking changes in residential UPRNs in England between 2020 and 2024

To use: download the repo and open the **england_res_UPRNs** file in Jupyter Notebooks.

Run all the cells in order.

The chart at the end shows the percentage change each year for the 9 England regions and the overall average.

It is slightly interactive - you can zoom in and pan around and tooltips show the region name, year and % change in residential UPRNs for each data point.

I'll add a map and some sliders shortly! However the amount of grouping I've done probably limits how much you could learn from this data. 
I'll make something more interesting soon now that I have a slightly better grasp of the tools.
